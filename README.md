blurfact doesn't work correctly first launch (maybe a TF2 issue?)
	
class loadout panel weapons and hats get cut off in 4:3 (fixed with overrides).

16:9 - made on 1920x1080. works for other resolutions

16:10 - works. maybe slight offsets. shouldn't be bad

4:3 - works. you need to use one override but everything else is fine (?)

SUPPORT FOR MANN VS MACHINE

as of right now, i will not be editing the mvm elements. i will do those at a later date. i do not play this gamemode often enough. i definitely will edit the elements later on, but i do not plan on it for a bit. the hud is definitely usable with MVM and i don't think it is bugged at all.  it just looks like stock for now. i'm currently not very sure what to do with the mvm elements in terms of making this work in the theme of overwatch.

CHOICES

some of the things i wanted to do in this hud were not possible.
	
i tried to make this hud as close as possible to the original overwatch hud.

i did not add animated backgrounds because it would add to the (already) big filesize. i do not want my hud to be half a gigabyte.

one of the things i wanted to do was put in a health bar; but i figured i'd much rather have the buff/hurt overlay.
	
if i had the buff/hurt overlay on, the health bar wouldn't work. i have no idea how to implement a health bar and even after trying to copy what mannterface did, i had no success. so i just went with the overlay instead of a health bar.
	
i was originally planning to make the backgrounds just overwatch maps, but i decided to stick with TF2 but have the same kinda vibe as the overwatch backgrounds. i had hanamura before, so i kept the vibe of hanamura by going with koth_suijin.
	
i used cp_reckoner for the background of the loadout subpanel.
