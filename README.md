TF2 HUD based off of Overwatch

Any questions? Ask in the TFTV thread

-------------- EXTRA NOTES ---------------

REPORTING BUGS

	if you encounter any bugs while using this hud, please report them in the teamfortresstv thread. commenting on my profile (steamcommunity.com/id/nimtra) works too, but the first option is much preferred. please provide a screenshot of it, if possible.
	
	i will do my best to update this as fast as possible. i have two maintain two huds and it is a little hard to do those. but i will make sure i get my huds updated as fast as possible.
	
	some things may be offset if you're using 16:10 or 4:3. make sure you use the overrides to fix (most of) these. i'm still in the process of finding everything that's broken. check out the "known issues" section to see if the issue you're having was already reported, however. if you find anything that's screwed up, let me know in the TFTV thread.
	
KNOWN ISSUES

	blurfact doesn't work correctly first launch (maybe a TF2 issue?)
	
	class loadout panel weapons and hats get cut off in 4:3 (fixed with overrides).
	
SUPPORT FOR MANN VS MACHINE

	as of right now, i will not be editing the mvm elements. i will do those at a later date. i do not play this gamemode often enough. i definitely will edit the elements later on, but i do not plan on it for a bit. the hud is definitely usable with MVM and i don't think it is bugged at all.  it just looks like stock for now. i'm currently not very sure what to do with the mvm elements in terms of making this work in the theme of overwatch.

CHOICES

	some of the things i wanted to do in this hud were not possible.
	
	i tried to make this hud as close as possible to the original overwatch hud.

	i did not add animated backgrounds because it would add to the (already) big filesize. i do not want my hud to be half a gigabyte.

	one of the things i wanted to do was put in a health bar; but i figured i'd much rather have the buff/hurt overlay.
	
	if i had the buff/hurt overlay on, the health bar wouldn't work. i have no idea how to implement a health bar and even after trying to copy what mannterface did, i had no success. so i just went with the overlay instead of a health bar.
	
	i was originally planning to make the backgrounds just overwatch maps, but i decided to stick with TF2 but have the same kinda vibe as the overwatch backgrounds. i had hanamura before, so i kept the vibe of hanamura by going with koth_suijin.
	
	i used cp_reckoner for the background of the loadout subpanel.
